# Changelog

Newest first. The Home page shows the top entry as "What's new".

## 2026-09-27 — Second league

- Several Sleeper leagues at once: `LEAGUE_LAB_SLEEPER_LEAGUE_ID=<id>,<id>`; the first is the
  *reference* league whose scoring prices NFL-wide pages. `?league=<id>` opens the app on a league;
  the sidebar lists where a league's scoring differs from the reference.
- Scoring keys a league might use that were unmapped are now recomputed: yardage-game bonuses
  (`bonus_rec_yd_100` …, exclusive buckets), 40+/50+ yard touchdowns (from play-by-play) and
  distance-bucketed missed field goals. Expected points leave bonuses out on purpose.
- Sleeper's "no previous league" marker (`"0"`) no longer produces a failed partition.

## 2026-09-26 — Share-ready beta

- Hosted publishing: `make sync-hosted` pushes the marts (never raw data) to a hosted Postgres in one
  atomic transaction; the app reads Streamlit secrets; optional beta password; feedback link.
- Sidebar **Table detail** toggle: *Essentials* hides denominators, noise statistics and fine-grained
  counts on every table; *Everything* shows every column.
- Home is a landing page: your week at a glance, what's new, data sources and licences.
- Rankings (page 4): a transparent weekly projection per position with form / usage / matchup / Vegas /
  home terms and a backtest scoreboard (2023–2025 out of sample).
- Play-by-play layer: first-read target share, routes proxy (TPRR / YPRR), context splits by half,
  score state, down & distance and QB on the play; true dropbacks; red-zone shares.
- Trends (page 3): which usage metrics moved over the last three games beyond a player's own noise;
  momentum; defenses getting softer or stiffer.
