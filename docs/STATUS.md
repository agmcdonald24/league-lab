## Evidence — real league data (sandbox replay of the Mac's Sleeper archive, 2026-09-26)

| Source | Partitions | Rows |
|---|---|---|
| nflverse (18 datasets) | 111 | 2,346,719 |
| sleeper (3 seasons) | 96 | 14,207 |

Database ≈ 1.05 GB; raw archive 52 MB.

* `dbt build`: **214 pass, 1 warn, 0 error** (215 nodes: 2 seeds, 61 models, 8 singular + 143 generic tests).
* The one warning: `assert_optimal_lineup_matches_sleeper_potential` — our optimal-lineup totals equal
  Sleeper's `ppts` for **29 of 30 rosters** across 2024–2026 (exact to the cent); the exception is
  2025 roster 6 at −9.70, a bench defense Sleeper did not count as potential.
* **Points reconciliation on the real league**: 4,240 mapped QB/RB/WR/TE/K player-weeks, **0** with
  |observed − recomputed| > 0.5, mean absolute difference 0.000. The scoring map is exact for this league.
* Identity: 7,415 accepted sleeper↔gsis mappings (was 6,197), 9 resolved by name confirmation
  (e.g. Conklin/Izzo swap between providers), 18 quarantined ambiguous pairs; 2 rostered skill
  players without an NFL id across three seasons (Trey Smack K 2026, Tyler Conklin 2024 — now resolved).
* Andrew's `dbt build` on the Mac (Phase 1, 2026-09-26 10:33): 152/152 pass.
* `pytest`: 14/14 · `ruff`: clean · Streamlit headless: 12/12 pages render; Team Hub / Waiver Wire /
  Matchups / Trade Finder / League Intel screenshots reviewed with the real roster.
* Sanity reads that came out of the marts (week 2 → 3, 2026): Victory is Mine! is 2-0 with a 4-14
  all-play record (+1.56 luck); GoodGameBuddy 0-2 with 12-6 all-play (−1.33); MacZaddy has 3.7 bench
  points left per week and the best lineup efficiency (97%); free-agent WR Malik Washington carries a
  26% target share on 85% snaps; Terry McLaurin (Run Bijan Run) is 7.2 ppg below his expected points.

## Hotfix 2026-09-26 (after Andrew's first `make ingest-nfl` on the Mac)

`rosters_weekly` 2016–2024 failed with *cannot alter type of a column used by a view*: the pilot had
loaded 2025/2026 (`height` integer), dbt had built views on top, and the backfill needed to widen the
column to double. Fix in `db.py`: (1) `downcast_to_existing` casts an incoming float column to the
stored integer type when every value is whole (lossless, no DDL — this is the `height` case); (2) when a
real widening is needed, dependent views are dropped with a logged warning and recreated by the next
`dbt build`. Reproduced and verified in the sandbox on both paths.

## Polish pass 2026-09-26 (Andrew's review of the Edge pages)

* Research page removed; Data Status renumbered to 10.
* `app/lib/table.py`: registry of every displayed column (label, kind, plain-English help); `show()` renders
  readable headers with hover definitions, % as %, booleans as words, blank nulls; `howto()` expanders next to
  every table; glossary on Home. All 11 pages rewritten on it. 11/11 headless page tests pass, screenshots reviewed.
* Identity: espn_id and sportradar_id bridges + source-majority rule → 8,063 accepted mappings (49 quarantined,
  all legacy name collisions / Sleeper "Duplicate Player" entries). One league player still unmapped (Trey Smack, K, 2026 rookie —
  no shared id in any source yet).
* Routes run: no free in-season source; see PROJECT_PLAN P2-12 for the plan.

## Trends 2026-09-26 (Andrew: "are players trending up or down and by which metrics")

* New seed `trend_metrics` (10 metrics), models `int_player_game_metric_long`, `mart_player_trends`,
  `mart_player_trend_tags`, `mart_defense_trends`; 7 new registry rows; definitions in METRICS.md "Trends".
* New page **3 Trends**; trend tags and momentum on Team Hub and Waiver Wire (momentum sort); weekly packs gained
  "Movers" (league recap) and "Your roster's trends" / "Free agents with rising opportunity" (team brief).
* Validated on the complete 2025 season: top risers Luke Musgrave (momentum 2.5: ↑ target share +9 pts, ↑ snaps +16 pts),
  Adam Thielen, Colston Loveland (+15 pts target share); defense trends NE-vs-QB stiffer (17.0 → 7.4 allowed),
  NYJ-vs-TE softer (10.1 → 23.1). 2026 has three games, so every player is `insufficient` by design and the page
  shows the early read (latest game vs season) until week 4 scores land.
* Page renumbering: 3 Trends, 4 Matchups, 5 Trade Finder, 6 League Intel, 7 League, 8 Players, 9 Receivers,
  10 Kickers, 11 Data Status (stale files moved to `backups/stale_iteration3/` on the Mac).
* Packs verified on 2025 week 17 (`--league-id 1256450429399617536`) and 2026 week 3.

## Phase 2 2026-09-26 — play-by-play, FTN charting, participation

* New raw datasets: `pbp` (2016–2026, 490k plays, core ~190-column subset), `pbp_participation`
  (2016–2025, published after each postseason so 2026 is expected-missing), `ftn_charting` (2022–2026).
  Mirrored with curl in the sandbox and loaded with `--offline` in 35 s; the Mac downloads ≈265 MB once.
* New models: `fct_play` (eligibility flags + context), `bridge_play_actor`, `bridge_play_participation`
  (4.9M rows), `fct_play_charting`, `int_team_game_pbp`, `int_player_game_pbp`, `int_play_context_long`,
  `mart_player_context` (153k rows); `fct_team_game` / `fct_player_game` / season marts / recent form /
  availability extended. `raw.routes_feed` + `league-lab import-routes` for a licensed routes file.
* **Reconciliation** (plan §9.4–9.6): play-derived targets = nflverse weekly targets in 4,533 of 4,533
  2025 player-weeks; over 5,344 team-games 2016–2026 sacks match everywhere, attempts differ in 4,
  targets in 2, carries in 1 (upstream stat corrections); dropbacks = attempts − spikes + sacks + scrambles
  holds in every team-game. Halves sum to season totals for every player (tolerance = those corrections).
  Manual first-read check PHI–DAL 2025 week 1: 3 first reads by hand = 3 in the mart.
* **Finding that changed the spec**: FTN `read_thrown = "0"` is *not* first read from 2023 (dictionary
  wording carried into MVP1_PLAN §6). `0` sits on every run/kick/punt and on 2–3% of throws (the slice
  that is NULL in 2022); `1` is the majority code on targeted throws in every season. Coded `1` = first
  read; documented in METRICS.md with the counts.
* **Routes**: the participation proxy runs ≈10–15% above charting-service route counts (Chase 2024:
  705 vs ≈615), so TPRR/YPRR proxies are lower bounds and are labelled proxy on every page. In-season
  routes still need a paid feed (import contract ready).
* Season marts now sum team denominators over **appearance games only** (`played`), per plan §5. This
  moved shares for special-teams-only players (e.g. Bo Melton 2025: 3.7% → 4.9%); fantasy-relevant
  players are unchanged.
* `dbt build`: **259 pass, 1 warn, 0 error** (260 nodes: 3 seeds, 71 models, 14 singular + 172 generic
  tests) in 1 m 58 s. `pytest`: 21/21 (7 new for the routes-feed contract). `ruff`: clean. 12/12 pages
  render; Receivers page screenshots reviewed (first-read table + chart, routes proxy, context splits).
* Sanity reads (2025 REG): first-read share leaders Garrett Wilson 47%, JSN 44%, Nabers 43%, London 43%,
  St. Brown 42%; Chase 72% of his own charted targets were first reads, Bijan 27%; Bo Nix 669 dropbacks
  (634 + 36 scrambles − spikes); Chase target share 35.5% in H1 vs 28.9% in H2; Garrett Wilson 47% first-read
  share with Fields vs 48% with Taylor.

## Rankings 2026-09-26 (Andrew: "a rankings model to rank players each week")

* Weekly feature snapshot `mart_player_week_features` (109k player-weeks 2016–2026), strictly as-of: a
  week-N row sees only games before week N (`assert_features_never_peek`). Universe = rostered
  QB/RB/WR/TE whose team plays; the upcoming week uses the latest published roster (2026 week 3 = 581 players).
* Baseline projection: OLS per position on 2019–2022 (`league-lab fit-rankings`), 13 features, weights in
  `seeds/ranking_weights.csv` and printed in METRICS.md; `mart_player_week_rankings` applies the same formula
  in SQL (`assert_rankings_apply_seed_formula`) with grouped contributions so the page can show *why*.
* **Backtest 2023–2025** (`league-lab backtest`, weights never saw these seasons; 54 season-weeks per position):
  baseline Spearman QB 0.501 / RB 0.670 / WR 0.604 / TE 0.573 vs best naive 0.469 / 0.644 / 0.565 / 0.524 —
  higher in all 12 position-seasons; top-N hit rate 51.9% / 62.3% / 46.4% / 46.3%. Report in `reports/backtests/`.
* Rankings page (4; later pages renumbered 5–12): live board for the next week with form / usage / matchup /
  Vegas / home terms, scope filters, "your players", contribution chart, the backtest scoreboard and the formula.
  Team brief gains week projections for the roster and the best projected free agents.
* Fix on the way: `show()` now coerces numeric kinds to float64 (an all-None column rendered the word "None").
* `dbt build`: **277 pass, 1 warn, 0 error** (278 nodes); `pytest` 21/21; `ruff` clean; 13/13 pages render.

## Share-ready beta 2026-09-26 (Andrew: "offer this publicly ... collect feedback")

* **Hosted publishing**: `scripts/sync_to_hosted.sh` / `make sync-hosted` publishes the analytics relations the
  pages and packs reference (derived from the code at run time: 35 of 49, ≈290 MB) plus seeds and `ops`, creating
  the read-only `league_lab_app` role. Drop-then-restore, not atomic: Neon's free tier caps a project at 0.5 GB and
  cannot hold two copies (the first atomic attempt failed on exactly that), so pages show "not built yet" for the
  restore's minute or two. `make refresh` runs it when `LEAGUE_LAB_HOSTED_ADMIN_URL` is set; refuses the local
  cluster. Simulated end to end in the sandbox; all 13 pages render against the hosted copy with the read-only role.
* **Live**: deployed 2026-09-26 on Neon (us-east-2) + Streamlit Community Cloud from `github.com/agmcdonald24/league-lab`.
  Found on the first walkthrough and fixed: the Receivers guard named a play-level table the hosted copy omits; the
  freshness banner counted historical failures (now: partitions whose latest attempt failed); the viewer toolbar
  showed Fork/GitHub (`client.toolbarMode = viewer`); secrets added after the first deploy needed a reboot (the
  bridge now re-reads secrets before every connection).
* **App for the cloud**: `st.secrets` → environment bridge (`LEAGUE_LAB_*`), optional beta password gate
  (`LEAGUE_LAB_APP_PASSWORD`), sidebar feedback button (`LEAGUE_LAB_FEEDBACK_URL`), `app/requirements.txt`
  (runtime only — Community Cloud reads the entrypoint directory's file first), `app/.streamlit/config.toml`.
* **UI**: sidebar **Table detail** toggle (Essentials hides denominators, z-scores, coverage and fine-grained counts on
  every table via one registry rule; Everything shows all); Home rebuilt as a landing page (what it is, your week at a
  glance — record, all-play, lineup efficiency, next opponent, highest projections, movers — pages, what's new from
  `CHANGELOG.md`, glossary, data & attribution with the FTN CC BY-SA note). Phone width verified.
* Hard-coded to the current league by Andrew's choice; "connect any league" (S-01/S-02) stays in the plan.
* `docs/HOSTING.md` is the step-by-step (Neon or Supabase free tier → GitHub → Streamlit Community Cloud → secrets).
* `dbt build` unchanged (277 pass, 1 warn); `pytest` 21/21; `ruff` clean; 13/13 pages render locally and against the hosted copy.

## Next concrete actions

1. **Andrew**: `make build && make app` to see the beta UI; then `docs/HOSTING.md` — Neon project, `.env` hosted lines, `make sync-hosted`, `git init` + GitHub, Streamlit Community Cloud with the three secrets. ~35 minutes.
2. **Andrew**: `git init && git add -A && git commit` is now step 2 of HOSTING.md (the repo is what Community Cloud deploys).
3. **Andrew (decisions)**: O03 refresh time, O05 backup destination, review of the Edge pages (U04), acceptance (H03).
4. **Next engineering** (Andrew's call): R-07 an ML challenger on the same harness (only kept if it beats the baseline);
   R-08 rest-of-season projections + lineup optimizer; P2-14 defensive participation for CB context; Phase 3 ops hardening; Phase 4 hosting.
